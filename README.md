CODE HACK 2022: helping various sections of society THEME 3: transportation

Our project is a website with front-end development. It focuses on the problem of increasing traffic, waste of fuel and protecting the environment from harmful gases like carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides released by vehicles. Wehicle!! puts forward and  helps implement the idea of car pooling. This idea of car pooling will help control the traffic and thus the pollution caused by these vehicles. The website is beneficial to both the ride partner and the person who offers the ride by reduced cost of transportation. Also, the person who offers the ride earns points which can be used to pay a ride in future.
